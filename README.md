# Summer-of-Making
Projects I'll build during the summer of making

An interactive site where you can make your own resume/portfolio. You can add sections such as about me, projects, or resume. If you want to use a template, there are one each for students, developers, and job-applicants. There are also design elements such as hero header or quote block, which will improve the design! You can either delete/restart the portfolio or download it as a pdf! There are also badges to mark you achievements regarding usage of the website. You can also edit it in details in the html editor.
