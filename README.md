*Song Mood Classifier*

The Song Mood Classifier is a web-based tool that analyzes lyrics to predict the emotional tone of a song using a simulated machine learning model. Users can paste lyrics, and the app highlights emotion-heavy words, displays a mood graph, and identifies the most likely mood based on keyword mapping. It also visualizes the mood as a color and provides a justification section showing which words influenced the result. Users can write diary entries about how the song made them feel, which are saved locally and displayed with delete options. The interface is styled with Bootstrap, animated for engagement, and includes a learning section to explain the tool's logic.

*Dream Analyzer*

Dream Analyzer is a web app that lets users record and reflect on their dreams. It analyzes dream descriptions using keywords and maps them to symbols, emotions, and archetypes. Users can choose how they felt, write a reflection, and receive personalized insights. The interface features an aurora background and a toggle for visual effects like fireflies or rain. The app uses simple keyword detection in the user's dream text to match common dream symbols (like flying, falling, or water) to predefined interpretations. Based on these symbols and the selected emotion, it generates insights using mapped themes, archetypes, and suggested actions. This dream analyzer also creates a calming and introspective experience!
